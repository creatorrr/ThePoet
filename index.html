					<p>A ballad of the Wisdom of the ages</p>

					<p>A surge of passion</p>
					<p>The unrelenting nostalgia</p>
					<p>Agony and regret</p>
					<p>Burn within the bosom</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Then it all fades away</p>
					<p>Visions subside</p>
					<p>Sounds muffle</p>
					<p>A gripping calm ensues</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Beyond all pain</p>
					<p>Beyond all pleasure</p>

					<p>I pass into nothingness</p>

					<h3>~ I have fallen in love. ~</h3>

					<p>I have fallen in love.</p>
					<p>With this wonderful world.</p>
					<p>With this beautiful life.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Look around.</p>
					<p>Everything is just so beautiful.</p>
					<p>It gives me so much happiness to live in the moment.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>To relish the sheer joy</p>
					<p>of learning something new everyday.</p>
					<p>The passion of work.</p>
					<p>The tranquility of solitude.</p>

					</section>
					<section>

					<p>Think about it.</p>
					<p>Let's just chuck all our worries in a closet.</p>
					<p>And lock it forever.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Let's learn how to live.</p>
					<p>Not just persist through our day.</p>
					<p>Have the courage to do what you love.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Those little things you never care about.</p>
					<p>Matter a lot.</p>
					<p>Pick up the phone.</p>

					<p>Tell people that you love them.</p>
					<p>Say sorry.</p>
					<p>Be grateful.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>You ain't got as much time as you think sonny.</p>
					<p>Laugh a little more.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Look at a mirror and smile.</p>
					<p>Know that no one can take that away.</p>
					<p>I'm only surprised why I've never done this before.</p>

					</section>
					<section>

					<p>Now, I smile. I dance. I cry.</p>
					<p>I can't waste even a single moment of my life in regret.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Anguish and pain are part of life.</p>
					<p>But, happiness too is an equal part.</p>
					<p>Accept them.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Learn from the moments of sorrow.</p>
					<p>Then, laugh them off.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Work. Hard.</p>
					<p>Play. Harder. </p>

					<p>Take part in a marathon.</p>
					<p>Run till your lungs burn.</p>
					<p>Relish the moment of victory.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Whatever you do.</p>
					<p>Listen to your heart.</p>
					<p>Don't let obsessions steal the fun.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Always know when to take a break.</p>
					<p>When to get on the table and dance.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>Just remember.</p>
					<p>Only one thing matters.</p>
					<p>And that's you.</p>
